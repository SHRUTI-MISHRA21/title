## Running the Project with Docker

This project is containerized using Docker and can be built and run easily with Docker Compose. Below are the project-specific instructions and requirements for running the application in a Docker environment.

### Project-Specific Docker Requirements
- **Base Image:** Uses `python:3.11-slim` for the runtime environment.
- **Dependencies:** All Python dependencies are specified in `requirements.txt` and installed in a virtual environment within the container.
- **Entrypoint:** The application starts with `python app/main.py`.
- **User:** Runs as a non-root user (`appuser`) inside the container for improved security.

### Environment Variables
- **No required environment variables** are specified in the Dockerfile or Docker Compose file. If you need to use environment variables, you can add an `.env` file and uncomment the `env_file` line in the `docker-compose.yml`.

### Build and Run Instructions
1. **Build and start the application:**
   ```sh
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   This will build the Docker image and start the batch processing application.

2. **Stopping the application:**
   ```sh
   docker compose down
   ```

### Special Configuration
- **No ports are exposed** as the application is a batch processor and does not provide a web interface.
- **No volumes or persistent storage** are configured, as the application does not require data persistence between runs.
- **No external services** (such as databases or caches) are required.

### Notes
- If you need to pass environment variables, create an `.env` file in the project root and uncomment the `env_file` line in the `docker-compose.yml`.
- The application code and dependencies are isolated in a Python virtual environment within the container.
